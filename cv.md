3. I am a surveying engineer by education, I graduated with a master's degree in 2021. Now I am trying to master a new profession, I have never been connected with programming anywhere, but I have many acquaintances in this field, and from their recommendations I realized that I like JavaScript. I really like learning new things, I am persistent and take criticism well.
4. Skills:
- JS (at a very basic level)
- Movavi video editor 
- Git
5. Code example
`let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let sum = a + b;
console.log("Сумма:", sum);`
6. I have no experience in programming, but I quickly learn new information.
