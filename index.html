        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am a surveying engineer by education, I graduated with a master's degree in 2021. Now I am trying to master a new profession, I have never been connected with programming anywhere, but I have many acquaintances in this field, and from their recommendations I realized that I like JavaScript. I really like learning new things, I am persistent and take criticism well.</p>
